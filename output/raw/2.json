  "text": "OWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Risks\nThe most current released version is the OWASP Top Ten 2025.\nPrevious versions are available at OWASP Top Ten 2021 and OWASP Top 10 2017 (PDF). Older versiona are available in the Github repo.\nThe OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.\nGlobally recognized by developers as the first step towards more secure coding.\nCompanies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces more secure code.\nEfforts have been made in numerous languages to translate the OWASP Top 10 - 2025. If you are interested in helping, please contact the members of the team for the language you are interested in contributing to, or if you don’t see your language listed (neither here nor at github), please email [email protected] to let us know that you want to help and we’ll form a volunteer group for your language.\nTranslations in progress - check back soon!\n- 翻译人员：陈亮、王厚奎、王颉、王文君、王晓飞、吴楠、徐瑞祝、夏天泽、杨璐、张剑钟、赵学文（排名不分先后，按姓氏拼音排列）\n- 审查人员：Rip、包悦忠、李旭勤、杨天识、张家银（排名不分先后，按姓氏拼音排列）\n- French: OWASP Top 10 2017 in French (Git/Markdown)\n- German: OWASP Top 10 2017 in German V1.0 (Pdf) (web pages)\ncompiled by Christian Dresen, Alexios Fakos, Louisa Frick, Torsten Gigler, Tobias Glemser, Dr. Frank Gut, Dr. Ingo Hanke, Dr. Thomas Herzog, Dr. Markus Koegel, Sebastian Klipper, Jens Liebau, Ralf Reinhardt, Martin Riedel, Michael Schaefer - Hebrew: OWASP Top 10-2017 - Hebrew (PDF) (PPTX)\ntranslated by Eyal Estrin (Twitter: @eyalestrin) and Omer Levi Hevroni (Twitter: @omerlh). - Japanese: OWASP Top 10-2017 - 日本語版 (PDF)\ntranslated and reviewed by Akitsugu ITO, Albert Hsieh, Chie TAZAWA, Hideko IGARASHI, Hiroshi TOKUMARU, Naoto KATSUMI, Riotaro OKADA, Robert DRACEA, Satoru TAKAHASHI, Sen UENO, Shoichi NAKATA, Takanori NAKANOWATARI ,Takanori ANDO, Tomohiro SANAE. - Korean: OWASP Top 10-2017 - 한글 (PDF) (PPTX)\n번역 프로젝트 관리 및 감수 : 박형근(Hyungkeun Park) / 감수(ㄱㄴㄷ순) : 강용석(YongSeok Kang), 박창렴(Park Changryum), 조민재(Johnny Cho) / 편집 및 감수 : 신상원(Shin Sangwon) / 번역(ㄱㄴㄷ순) : 김영하(Youngha Kim), 박상영(Sangyoung Park), 이민욱(MinWook Lee), 정초아(JUNG CHOAH), 조광렬(CHO KWANG YULL), 최한동(Handong Choi) - Portuguese: OWASP Top 10 2017 - Portuguese (PDF) (ODP)\ntranslated by Anabela Nogueira, Carlos Serrão, Guillaume Lopes, João Pinto, João Samouco, Kembolle A.

This data should come from a variety of sources; security vendors and consultancies, bug bounties, along with company/organizational contributions. Data will be normalized to allow for level comparison between Human assisted Tooling and Tooling assisted Humans.\nPlan to leverage the OWASP Azure Cloud Infrastructure to collect, analyze, and store the data contributed.\nWe plan to support both known and pseudo-anonymous contributions. The preference is for contributions to be known; this immensely helps with the validation/quality/confidence of the data submitted. If the submitter prefers to have their data stored anonymously and even go as far as submitting the data anonymously, then it will have to be classified as “unverified” vs. “verified”.\nScenario 1: The submitter is known and has agreed to be identified as a contributing party.\nScenario 2: The submitter is known but would rather not be publicly identified.\nScenario 3: The submitter is known but does not want it recorded in the dataset.\nScenario 4: The submitter is anonymous. (Should we support?)\nThe analysis of the data will be conducted with a careful distinction when the unverified data is part of the dataset that was analyzed.\nThere are a few ways that data can be contributed:\n- Email a CSV/Excel file with the dataset(s) to [email protected]\n- Upload a CSV/Excel file to https://bit.ly/OWASPTop10Data\nTemplate examples can be found in GitHub: https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/tree/master/2025/Data\nWe plan to accept contributions to the new Top 10 until July 31, 2025, for data dating from 2021 to 2024.\nThe following data elements are required or optional.\nThe more information provided the more accurate our analysis can be.\nAt a bare minimum, we need the time period, total number of applications tested in the dataset, and the list of CWEs and counts of how many applications contained that CWE.\nIf at all possible, please provide the additional metadata, because that will greatly help us gain more insights into the current state of testing and vulnerabilities.\n- Geographic Region (Global, North America, EU, Asia, other)\n- Primary Industry (Multiple, Financial, Industrial, Software, ??)\n- Whether or not data contains retests or the same applications multiple times (T/F)\n- A list of CWEs w/ count of applications found to contain that CWE\nIf at all possible, please provide core CWEs in the data, not CWE categories.\nThis will help with the analysis, any normalization/aggregation done as a part of this analysis will be well documented.\nIf a contributor has two types of datasets, one from HaT and one from TaH sources, then it is recommended to submit them as two separate datasets.\nHaT = Human assisted Tools (higher volume/frequency, primarily from tooling)\nTaH = Tool assisted Human (lower volume/frequency, primarily from human testing)\nSimilarly to the Top Ten 2021, we plan to conduct a survey to identify up to two categories of the Top Ten that the community believes are important, but may not be reflected in the data yet. We plan to conduct the survey in early 2025, and will be utilizing Google forms in a similar manner as last time. The CWEs on the survey will come from current trending findings, CWEs that are outside the Top Ten in data, and other potential sources.\nAt a high level, we plan to perform a level of data normalization; however, we will keep a version of the raw data contributed for future analysis. We will analyze the CWE distribution of the datasets and potentially reclassify some CWEs to consolidate them into larger buckets. We will carefully document all normalization actions taken so it is clear what has been done.\nWe plan to calculate likelihood following the model we continued in 2021 to determine incidence rate instead of frequency to rate how likely a given app may contain at least one instance of a CWE. This means we aren’t looking for the frequency rate (number of findings) in an app, rather, we are looking for the number of applications that had one or more instances of a CWE. We can calculate the incidence rate based on the total number of applications tested in the dataset compared to how many applications each CWE was found in.\nIn addition, we will be developing base CWSS scores for the top 20-30 CWEs and include potential impact into the Top 10 weighting.\nAlso, would like to explore additional insights that could be gleaned from the contributed dataset to see what else can be learned that could be of use to the security and development communities."
