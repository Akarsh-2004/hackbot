Since then we are making steady progress towards professionalizing DBpedia for its users and forming an effective network out of the loosely organised DBpedia community.\nDBpedia features around 20 language chapters which are concerned with the improvement and extraction of data from the language-specific Wikipedia versions. The chapters are part of the DBpedia executives who have taken on the responsibility to contribute to the infrastructure of DBpedia.\nMembers of the DBpedia community have been contributing to the expansion and stabilization of DBpedia since 2007. It started as a small project in Leipzig which grew into a large crowd-sourced project with scientists and researchers using the DBpedia Open Knowledge Graph worldwide.\nSince the emergence of the LOD Cloud in 2007 DBpedia constitutes the main resource of Linked Open Data on the Web containing more than 228 million entities to date. With the rapid growth of published LOD-datasets DBpedia evolved to the most interconnected freely available knowledge graph on the Web. Out of its popularity, numerous further resources emerged and have been created by and for research and industry for various purposes. As of today, a large community of Linked Data enthusiasts is continuously contributing\nto the advancement of DBpedia. As a result, the main DBpedia Knowledge Graph encompassing cleaned data from Wikipedia in all languages and Wikidata reaches over 600k file downloads per year.\nDiscover and use the numerous DBpedia-related datasets and tools that have been developed providing data access, versioning, quality control, ontology visualization, linking infrastructures, and much more!\n- Did you consider this information as helpful?\nGet the DBpedia latest core dataset here! It contains a small but useful subset of datasets from the DBpedia Extractions. With the help of Databus Latest-Core Collection, it is quite easy to fetch a fresh custom-tailored selection of DBpedia files for a specific use case.
