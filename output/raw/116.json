  "text": "MIMIC-IV is separated into “modules” to reflect the provenance of the data.\nPatient demographics, admission tracking, and stay information is available in MIMIC-Core.\nThe Hosp module provides all data acquired from the hospital wide electronic health record. This includes laboratory measurements, microbiology cultures, medication information, services provided, billed diagnoses and procedures, and so on.\nThe ICU module contains information collected from the clinical information system used within the ICU. This includes highly granular information such as hour-to-hour vital signs, information about fluid management, and other charted observations.\nThe ED module contains data for emergency department patients including a triage assessment, nurse-validated vital signs, medicine reconciliation, and treatment information.\nMIMIC-cxr provides chest x-ray images and radiology reports for a subset of patients admitted to the emergency department.\nThe Note module contains deidentified free-text clinical notes for hospitalized patients.\nMIMIC-III is an older version of MIMIC. It contains an older group of patients (ending in 2012), and a subset of the ICU and hospital information available in MIMIC-IV. We highly recommend researchers starting new studies to use the above modules in MIMIC-IV. We will maintain MIMIC-III for a short period to allow researchers to transition."
