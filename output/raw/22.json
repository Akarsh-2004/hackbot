  "text": "You have entered the pwn.college DOJO, an education platform for learners to develop and practice core cybersecurity skills in a hands-on fashion.\nEntering, you receive your \"white belt\" , signifying the beginning of your hacker life.\nFrom here, you will learn cybersecurity by diving deep into the core of computing, using that journey to absorb cybersecurity concepts.\nThis will involve melding your mind to your terminal, whispering instructions to the CPU, and strumming bits directly onto networks.\nIt will be your stalwart companion through this adventure as you practice, earn your belts , and, eventually, make perfect.\nThis platform is maintained by an awesome team of hackers at Arizona State University.\nIt powers much of ASU's cybersecurity curriculum, and is open, for free, to participation for interested people around the world!\nThe challenges created for pwn.college are, first and foremost, educational material, and are used to grade students at universities around the world.\nBecause of this, we would appreciate that you do not post writeups, walkthrough videos, and livestreams of challenge solutions to the internet.\nObviously, we can't enforce this, but we worked hard to make all of this public, and we would appreciate your help in keeping pwn.college a viable educational platform.\nPlease agree to these rules to continue to the material!\nWhether you have just started, or have come far, there is always a next step to your journey.\nThe dojo or dojos listed below is that step, presented to you in the order that you should learn them.\nTake a step, and the next will reveal itself.\nWant to use pwn.college in your course? No problem!\nYou can use the videos and slides of pwn.college lectures freely for non-commercial purposes, but please provide attribution!\nAdditionally, if you use pwn.college in your own education program, we would appreciate it if you email us to let us know.\nEvidence of wide-spread use of pwn.college for education will be a huge help for our various academic careers!\nEDUCATORS: If you are an educational institution and are using pwn.college as part of a class, you can import our challenges (or add your own) into your own private dojo for your students! Create your dojo here.\nCONFERENCES: If you are running a conference and would like pwn.college presence there (as a form of intense weekend-long training), please email us!\nEventually, hackers continue their journey beyond pwn.college, becoming certain in their skills, achieving brown belt status (and able to, for example, usefully contribute to the cybersecurity industry and academia), before finally graduating to hacking masters: black belts.\nBut this, unfortunately, must happen outside of the dojo (for now!).\nCapture The Flags (CTFs) are a great way to practice your hacking skills in a fun and ethical way. The most popular way to find upcoming events is at https://ctftime.org. There is also a list of introductory CTFs here. If you are at ASU, feel free to check out and join ASU’s enigmatic hacking club.\nWargames are another great way to practice your hacking skills. Whereas CTFs are short (normally 48 hour) events, wargames are not time-based. You can find a list of wargames at https://github.com/zardus/wargame-nexus.\nThere are many other awesome learning platforms, such as CryptoHack and OST2 that will help teach you explore new topics!\nIf you want to get involved with cybersecurity research, but don’t know how, consider joining us for an internship at ASU.\nThe infrastructure powering pwn.college is open source, and we welcome pull requests and issues.\nSome of the modules are closed-source, because they include source code and solution scripts, but others can be found on github.\nIf you are an educator, or otherwise someone we trust, and are interested in collaborating on the modules themselves, please email us at [email protected].\nLikewise, drop us a line if you are interested in collaborating on the slides!\nWe use a lot of different resources and platforms."
