  "text": "Vulnerability intelligence and core features\nCVEdetails.com offers a complete CVE database enhanced with additional information including advisories, exploits, tools, source code changes and much more.\nCVEs in CISA KEV catalog give users quick access to a list of vulnerabilities exploited in the wild.\nEPSS scores provides users with a list of vulnerabilities with increased risk.\nSet up email alerts for new CVEs or when new exploits are discovered for CVEs. Or create CVE feeds which can be integrated with tools like Slack or Outlook. Or use our APIs to query CVEs, exploits and other data.\nGet an overview of your external attack surface, and products/services running on your IPs.\nCreate your own tech stacks to manage vulnerabilities affecting products you use. Analyze SBOM files and report vulnerabilities affecting dependencies in the SBOM file.\nCVEdetails.com provides CPE information for most CVEs, even if they are not provided by NVD. Unfortunately NVD is no longer a reliable source of CVE information and CVEdetails.com compansates this issue by automated and manual analysis. Even if NVD was completely shutdown CVEdetails.com can continue providing CVE information with CPEs.The new CVEdetails.com\nCVEdetails.com now offers much more than just CVEs! Advisories, exploits, RSS feeds and various other vulnerability intelligence features have been added along with APIs, email alerts, feeds and more.\nWe want to save our users from Googling for information! We want to make our users more efficient and productive by providing them with easy access to information and the necessary utilities.\nWe want to become your one-stop shop for anything related to vulnerabilities. Instead of using 20 different tools and 50 web sites, you should only need CVEdetails.\nSee updates and change log for more information.\nFeel free to reach us at admin@cvedetails.com if you have any questions/concerns or feedback.\nWhy do you need vulnerability intelligence?\nUsing a house analogy, your house have many doors and windows, and there will always be burglars and other parties with bad intentions outside.To secure your house, you first need to know how many windows and doors you have (attack surface), if your doors and windows are secured properly and if they can be opened due to some defects in your locks or similar (vulnerability intelligence).\nExistence of burglars in your neighbourhood or whether burglars are targeting specific lock types etc (threat intelligence) won't help much unless you keep your house secure. Even if you track every single known burglar, given the opportunity, some random person, even without prior experience, may break into your house.\nWe understand that you need to keep up with everything with limited time and resources! We are here to make life easier for you."
