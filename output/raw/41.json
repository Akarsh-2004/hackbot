  "text": "Saw the Q1 2026 security list thread and noticed the same pattern from last year: pentest findings → technical debt → third-party risk → access reviews.\nIt's sequential. It's sensible. It's also incomplete.\nThe gap: None of those address the fundamental infrastructure problem that makes all the other issues harder to fix.\nHere's what I'm asking leadership teams right now:\nWhen you address a pentest finding about credential misuse, are you:\nA) Patching the specific issue (fixing a symptom)\nB) Rebuilding credential architecture to make misuse structurally harder (fixing the cause)\nMost teams choose A. Faster. Cleaner metrics for board reporting.\nBut if you're doing B, your Q1 becomes very different. You're not adding tools to detect bad behavior; you're redesigning infrastructure so bad behavior stands out immediately.\nThis is where the conversation gets weird, because it means:\nYour VPN architecture matters (not just for remote workers, but for credential isolation)\nYour internal comms layer is part of your perimeter defense\nAccess reviews become audit trails of structural security, not just permission sprawl\nI've walked through this with three organizations now. The teams that rebuilt Q1 around infrastructure redesign (instead of accumulating patches) reported:\n60% fewer findings in follow-up pentests (not because they improved at testing, but because the infrastructure was harder to break)\nClearer evidence of unauthorized access (because normal access patterns are architected, not just monitored)\nWrote a full breakdown of how to actually approach Q1 planning if you're willing to think structurally rather than tactically.\nFor folks planning Q1, albeit a bit on-the-fly like myself aha are you thinking structural or tactical? Curious what the conversation is in other organizations."
