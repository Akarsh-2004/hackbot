  "text": "We introduce Topical-Chat, a knowledge-grounded human-human conversation dataset where the underlying knowledge spans 8 broad topics and conversation partners don’t have explicitly defined roles.\nTopical-Chat broadly consists of two types of files:\n- Conversations: JSON files containing conversations between pairs of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers.\n- Reading Sets: JSON files containing knowledge sections rendered as reading content to the Turkers having conversations.\nreading sets for the dataset, by making API calls\nFor detailed information about the dataset, modeling benchmarking experiments and evaluation results, please refer to our paper.\nAfter cloning this repo, please run the following commands, preferably after creating a virtual environment:\nand manually add them to src/reddit/prawler.py\nThe scripts in this repo have been tested with Python 3.7 and we recommend using Python 3.7.\nown Reddit credentials in src/reddit/prawler.py\nwill read each file in reading_sets/pre-build/\ncreate a replica JSON with the exact same name and the actual reading\nsets included in reading_sets/post-build/\n| Stat | Train | Valid Freq. | Valid Rare | Test Freq. | Test Rare | All |\n| # of conversations | 8628 | 539 | 539 | 539 | 539 | 10784 |\n| # of utterances | 188378 | 11681 | 11692 | 11760 | 11770 | 235281 |\n| average # of turns per conversation | 21.8 | 21.6 | 21.7 | 21.8 | 21.8 | 21.8 |\n| average length of utterance | 19.5 | 19.8 | 19.8 | 19.5 | 19.5 | 19.6 |\nThe data is split into 5 distinct groups: train, valid frequent, valid rare, test frequent and test rare. The frequent set contains entities frequently seen in the training set. The rare set contains entities that were infrequently seen in the training set.\nFor each conversation to be collected, we applied a random knowledge configuration from a pre-defined list of configurations, to construct a pair of reading sets to be rendered to the partnered Turkers. Configurations were defined to impose varying degrees of knowledge symmetry or asymmetry between partner Turkers, leading to the collection of a wide variety of conversations.\n“content”: [ # ordered list of conversation turns\n“knowledge_source” : [“AS1”, “Personal Knowledge”, ...],\n- conversation_id: A unique identifier for a conversation in Topical-Chat\n- article_url: URL pointing to the Washington Post article associated with a conversation\n- config: The knowledge configuration applied to obtain a pair of reading sets for a conversation\n- content: An ordered list of conversation turns\n- agent: An identifier for the Turker who generated the message\n- message: The message generated by the agent\n- sentiment: Self-annotation of the sentiment of the message\n- knowledge_source: Self-annotation of the section within the agent's reading set used to generate this message\n- turn_rating: Partner-annotation of the quality of the message\n- conversation_rating: Self-annotation of the quality of the conversation\n- agent_1: Rating of the conversation by Turker 1\n- agent_2: Rating of the conversation by Turker 2\nEach JSON file in reading_sets/post-build/\n“shortened_wiki_lead_section”: <section text>,\n“fun_facts”: [ <fact1_text>, <fact2_text>,…]\n“shortened_wiki_lead_section”: <section text>,\n“fun_facts”: [ <fact1_text>, <fact2_text>,…],\n- conversation_id: A unique identifier for a conversation in Topical-Chat\n- config: The knowledge configuration applied to obtain a pair of reading sets for a conversation\n- agent_{1/2}: Contains the factual sections in this agent's reading set\n- FS{1/2/3}: Identifier for a factual section\n- shortened_wiki_lead_section: A shortened version of the Wikipedia lead section of the entity\n- summarized_wiki_lead_section: A (TextRank) summarized version of the Wikipedia lead section of the entity\n- fun_facts: Crowdsourced and manually curated fun facts about the entity from Reddit's r/todayilearned subreddit\n- FS{1/2/3}: Identifier for a factual section\n- article: A Washington Post article common to both partners'\n- url: URL pointing to the Washington Post article associated with a conversation\n- headline: The headline of the Washington Post article\n- AS{1/2/3/4}: A chunk of the body of the Washington Post article\n<shortened wiki lead section text>: <unique_identifier>,\n<shortened wiki lead section text>: <unique_identifier>\n<summarized wiki lead section text>: <unique_identifier>,\n<summarized wiki lead section text>: <unique_identifier>\nIf you use Topical-Chat in your work, please cite with the following:\n@inproceedings{gopalakrishnan2019topical,\nauthor={Karthik Gopalakrishnan and Behnam Hedayatnia and Qinlang Chen and Anna Gottardi and Sanjeev Kwatra and Anu Venkatesh and Raefer Gabriel and Dilek Hakkani-Tür},\ntitle={{Topical-Chat: Towards Knowledge-Grounded Open-Domain Conversations}},\nurl={http://dx.doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2019-3079}\nGopalakrishnan, Karthik, et al. \"Topical-Chat: Towards Knowledge-Grounded Open-Domain Conversations.\", Proc.
