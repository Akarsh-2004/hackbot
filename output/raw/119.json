Structure neighbors for every structure in MMDB are pre-computed and accessible via links on the MMDB Structure Summary pages.\nViral Genomes Curated sequence data and related information for the community.\nViral Genotyping Tool This tool helps identify the genotype of a viral sequence.\nVirus Variation Extension of the Influenza Virus Resource to other organisms, providing an interface to download sequence sets of selected viruses; analysis tools, including virus-specific BLAST pages; and genome annotation pipelines (in progress).\nVisible Human Project Three-dimensional representations of the human male and female bodies.\nWater Emergency Response for Libraries Steps on what you should do after a water emergency in your library or cultural heritage institution.\nWhole Genome Shotgun Sequences Whole genome shotgun sequence data organized by the 4-digit project code. Data include GenBank and GenPept flat files, quality scores and summary statistics."
