List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.\nThis project is maintained by Daniel Miessler, Jason Haddix, Ignacio Portal and g0tmi1k.\nwget -c https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/archive/master.zip -O SecList.zip && unzip SecList.zip && rm -f SecList.zip\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git\ngit clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git\n- Assetnote Wordlists: High quality wordlists for content and subdomain discovery which are automatically updated every month.\n- fuzz.txt: Wordlists of \"potentially dangerous\" files.\n- FuzzDB: Dictionary of attack patterns and primitives for black-box application fault injection and resource discovery.\n- PayloadsAllTheThings: A list of useful payloads and bypass for Web Application Security and Pentest/CTF\n- BiblePass: Wordlists compiled from Bible verses\n- SamLists: Data-driven wordlists containing HTTP parameter names, directory names and filenames.\n- Cook: A wordlist framework.
