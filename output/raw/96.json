Due to memory and compute limits (I’m currently using Google Colab), I can’t load the entire dataset into memory at once.\nPerformed EDA on the sample to understand distributions, correlations, and basic patterns\nHowever, I’m concerned that sampling may lose important data context, especially:\nRare categories that may not appear in the sample\nSo I’m considering an alternative approach using pandas chunking:\nConcatenate everything at the end into a final DataFrame\nIs this chunk-based approach actually safe and scalable for ~30M rows in pandas?\nWhich types of preprocessing / feature engineering are not safe to do chunk-wise due to missing global context?\nIf sampling can lose data context, what’s the recommended way to analyze and process such large datasets while still capturing outliers and rare patterns?\nSpecifically for Google Colab, what are best practices here?\n-Multiple passes over data? -Storing intermediate results to disk (Parquet/CSV)? -Using Dask/Polars instead of pandas?\n-Limited RAM -Correct statistical behavior -Practical workflows (not enterprise Spark clusters)\nWould love to hear how others handle large datasets like this in Colab or similar constrained environments"
