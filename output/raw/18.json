To spice up the learning, we have a \"Hacker of the Month\" where we recognize the most progressive employee in our lab environment.\nAlexis Lingad, Information Security Analyst, PUMA SE\nHack The Box has been an invaluable resource in developing and training our team. The content is extremely engaging through the gamified approach and the pace at which new and high quality content is updated ensures our team's skills are always sharp. The labs offer a breadth of technical challenge and variety, unparalleled anywhere else in the market.\nJosiah Beverton, Lead Security Consultant, Context\nHack The Box has been great for recruitment to quickly establish the caliber of ethical hacking candidates . The platform provides a credible overview of a professional's skills and ability when selecting the right hire. An active HTB profile strengthens a candidate's position in the job market, making them stand out from the crowd and highlighting their commitment to skill development.\nMy team and I used Professional Labs from Hack The Box to get used to the new trends of the Red Team concept. After a lot of positive frustration, dedication, and self-study we managed to finish the challenge and leave with much more knowledge than we had before. I strongly recommend this service to teams composed of dedicated persons, who love the technical aspects of penetration testing and also enjoy assisted self-study.\nSilas Francisco, Lead Penetration Tester, SIEMENS\nOur offensive security team was looking for a real-world training platform to test advanced attack tactics. We couldn't be happier with the Professional Labs environment. The lab was fully dedicated, so we didn't share the environment with others. The HTB support team has been excellent to make the training fit our needs.\nChristian Adounvo, Head of Offensive Security, NortonLifeLock\nThe best defense is a good offensive mindset. Hack The Box has enabled our security engineers a deeper understanding on how adversaries work in a real world environment. I provided a learn-at-your-own-pace training experience for my team and track progress towards agreed upon goals. Their knowledge of exploitation, privilege escalation, and system enumeration has grown exponentially since purchasing HTB.\nRichard Kaufmann, Information Security Professional, Amedisys\nAs defenders, it would be a great mistake to think that offensive knowledge is not a must-have in our skillset. HTB Academy helps our team gain that knowledge at their own pace, by providing quality and easy-to-follow content. From the curious software engineer to our best analysts, custom learning paths allow us to build the best experience for every kind of security enthusiast.\nJohn Ao, L3 SOC Analyst, Dassault Systemes\nDeployment of boxes on the Hack The Box Enterprise Platform is as easy as pressing a button and within one minute, the box is available. By making use of the Enterprise platform and Hack The Box Academy, we have been able to onboard new joiners more efficiently and promote internal mobility for our security assessments team.\nFirat Acar, Red Team Cybersecurity Consultant at NVISO\nFill the form to schedule a live product demo and Q&A about our cyber readiness solutions.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nThe #1 platform to build attack-ready teams and organizations\nMaximum curriculum management flexibility, enhanced skills reporting, and engaging gamification features.
